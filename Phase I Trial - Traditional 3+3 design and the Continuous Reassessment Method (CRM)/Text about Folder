This folder will discuss Phase I of the clinical trials. In another folder, the 3 + 3 design was also discussed. But here, some basic questions and answers regarding traditional 3 + 3 design and the continuous reassessment method (CRM) were discussed. This folder does not have any R code files (because an online simulator was used. The link to the online simulator was given inside the question file. Though it is not the best simulator :( ). It contains one pdf for questions and another pdf for answers. Questions are asked from different points of view so that basic differences can be easily understandable. All the answers mentioned in all folders are prepared by me. There could be better ways to solve those.
