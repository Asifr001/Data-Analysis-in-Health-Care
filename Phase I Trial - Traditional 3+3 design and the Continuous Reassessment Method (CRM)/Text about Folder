This folder will discuss Phase I of the clinical trials. Here, some basic questions and answers regarding traditional 3 + 3 design and the continuous reassessment method (CRM) were discussed. This folder does not have any R code files (because an online simulator was used). It contains one pdf for questions and another pdf for answers. Questions are asked from different points of view so that basic differences can be easily understandable. All the answers mentioned in all folders are prepared by me. There could be better ways to solve those.
