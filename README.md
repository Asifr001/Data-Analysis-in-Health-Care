# Data-Analysis-in-Health-Care

This project is dedicated to exploring the realm of healthcare through data-driven insights and analysis. This project aims to leverage data science methodologies to understand, interpret, and derive meaningful conclusions from healthcare-related datasets.

This project will start with basic statistical ideas and then step by step discuss various problems and suggest answers related to these topics:

a. Randomization and study blindness; Outcome adaptive randomization; Sample size/power; Hypothesis testing vs. estimation

b. Data collection and quality control; Statistical methods for trial monitoring; Early termination due to toxicity, efficacy, or lack of efficacy

c. Phase I – 3+3 design and also traditional 3+3 design and the continuous reassessment method (CRM)

d. Phase II – single arm designs, one-stage and multi-stage designs, designs based on predictive probability, and Phase II – randomized designs.

e. Bayesian Design: Bayesian sample size calculation; Beta-binomial models and methods for binary outcomes.

f. More Bayesian Design: Bayesian sample size calculation; Beta-binomial models and methods for binary outcomes.

g. Adaptive designs using binary endpoints; Response-adaptive randomization;

h. Phase III study: Repeated significance testing

i. More Phase III study: Repeated significance testing

j. Phase III design: Classical sequential methods; Group sequential methods; Interim analysis

k. Sample size calculation in phase III study

This repository will have both theoretical questions as well as analytical questions for better understanding.

I prepared all the answers and R codes mentioned in this project. Obviously, there could be better ways to solve those. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated.

For more details and a better understanding these 2 books can be very helpful:
