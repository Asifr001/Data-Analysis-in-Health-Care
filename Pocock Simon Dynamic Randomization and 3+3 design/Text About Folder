This folder contains some basic questions regarding Pocock Simon Dynamic Randomization and 3 + 3 design. And also about the main objective of phase I clinical trials, predetermined dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and Maximum tolerated dose (MTD). For a better understanding, the question contains both theoretical and analytical questions. So, this folder has 1 question (doc) file and 3 separate answer files -

1. An Excel sheet for the Pocock - Simon dynamic randomization method 

2. R code file for answering the questions related to 3 + 3 design and 

3. A pdf explaining everything.

All the answers mentioned here are prepared by me including R code and theoretical answer. Of course, there could be better ways to solve those.

For more details and a better understanding these 2 books can be very helpful:
