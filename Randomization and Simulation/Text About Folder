This folder contains some sample questions and answers related to clinical Randomization and Simulation. Here at first, problems related to binomial distribution, and type I and II errors were discussed. Finally, permutated block randomization with a block size of both 8 and 40 were discussed. 
It contains one doc file for questions and another R code file for answers. All the answers mentioned here are prepared by me. Obviously, there could be better ways to solve those.
